## Sectional Architecture (Timeline)

| Time | Section | Bars | Description |
|------|---------|------|--------------|
| 0:00 | A – Field | 1–8 | Guitar establishes harmonic field. Bass anchor. Flugelhorn silent. |
| 0:45 | B – Mirror Counterpoint | 9–18 | Flugelhorn enters with sustained tones. Guitar responds. Bass holds. |
| 1:30 | C – Dissolve | 19–28 | Texture thins. Single-line entries. Space expands. |
| 2:15 | D – Return | 29–36 | Fragmented recall of A material. No resolution. |

## Key Centres per Section

- **A:** Ab major (4 flats). Stable. Vertical harmony.
- **B:** Ab with Eb-over-Ab colour. Slight destabilisation.
- **C:** Ab drifts toward F. No cadence.
- **D:** Ab implied. Fades without closure.

---

## Motivic Material

- **Cell 1:** Eb5–G5 dyad (flugelhorn). Lyrical foil.
- **Cell 2:** C5 sustained. Axis tone.
- **Cell 3:** Ab4–Db5 span. Bass-register anchor.
- **Cell 4:** F#5 single tone. Destabilising pivot.

No development in traditional sense. Cells recur in varied density.

---

## Bass Motion Logic

- Pedal Ab in A. Moves to Eb in B. Sparse motion in C. Returns to Ab in D.
- No walking. No functional bass lines. Gravity anchor only.
- Entries on beat 1 or after long rests. No pulse reinforcement.

## Texture Density Arc

```
Density:  low ──────► medium ───► low ──────► very low
          A          B           C           D
```

Guitar carries density. Flugelhorn adds sparingly. Bass constant but minimal.

## Entry/Exit Cues

| Instrument | Entry | Exit |
|------------|-------|------|
| Guitar | Bar 1. Defines field. | Sustains to end. Fade. |
| Bass | Bar 1. Pedal. | Holds. No cadence. |
| Flugelhorn | Bar 5 (A) or Bar 9 (B). First sustained tone. | Last note fades. No resolution. |

## Harmonic Field Description

Ab major as base. Guitar voicings avoid root-position triads. Quartal and cluster shapes. Eb-over-Ab in B creates mild tension. C section: harmonic field thins to single lines. D: implied Ab. No V–I. No dominant function.

---

## Performance Intent Notes

- Guitar defines harmonic field. No jazz comping. No block chords.
- Flugelhorn lyrical foil. Sustained tones. No bebop phrasing.
- Bass gravity anchor. No walking. Space structural.
- Silence is structural. Do not fill. Preserve asymmetry.
