CURSOR PROMPT — ANDREW HILL ECM COMPOSITION ENGINE (Guitar/Bass/Flugelhorn)
Version: v1.1.0
Repo: https://github.com/mikeb55/Andrew-Hill-Engine
Local Root: C:\Users\mike\Documents\Cursor AI Projects\Andrew-Hill-Engine

Important global constraints:
- Do not optimise phrasing. Do not balance symmetry. Preserve asymmetry.
- Generate architecture + cells first; harmony is "fields," not functional progressions.
- Output NOTHING below GCE ≥9.0. Use an auto-evaluation loop and revise until ≥9.0.
- No bebop autopilot: ban continuous 8th-note streams and II–V target thinking.
- ECM trio instrumentation ONLY: Guitar, Upright Bass, Flugelhorn (NO trumpet, NO piano, NO drums).

GIT INSTRUCTIONS (print at end; do not execute)

cd "C:\Users\mike\Documents\Cursor AI Projects\Andrew-Hill-Engine"
git add .
git commit -m "Add Andrew Hill ECM Composition Engine v1.1.0 with example output"
git push origin main

========================================================
GOAL

Build a reusable "Andrew Hill–informed Composition Engine" for:
Guitar – Upright Bass – Flugelhorn

Engine must:
A) Generate asymmetrical forms (odd bar counts, non-symmetric returns)
B) Generate harmonic atmospheres (HAB blocks) for guitar + bass (non-functional)
C) Generate intervallic melodic cells for flugelhorn (non-scalar, motif-led)
D) Provide constrained "open zones"
E) Output one complete example piece (40–70 bars)
F) Self-evaluate with GCE ≥9.0 and revise until pass

========================================================
ENGINE DEFINITIONS

See spec/ENGINE_SPEC_v1.1.0.md for full module definitions (HAB, CELL, FORM, Plane Shift, texture zones, rhythmic constraints).

========================================================
QUALITY GATE — GCE ≥9.0 LOOP (MANDATORY)

Score 0–10:
1) Structural Architecture
2) Motivic Integrity
3) Harmonic Atmosphere
4) Texture/Orchestration
5) ECM Aesthetic
6) Anti-Generic Safeguards
7) Playability
8) Afterglow

If any <8.5 → revise.
If average <9.0 → revise.
Preserve asymmetry. Prefer subtraction over addition.
