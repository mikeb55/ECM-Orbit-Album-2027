## Section-by-Section Summary of Changes

**1) Mid-Section Density Reduction**
- Removed: D7alt from bar 27 (B section densest passage 25–28).
- Extended: Cm9 from 1 bar to 3 bars (bars 25–27). Bar 28 G7alt.
- Axis logic intact: Cm–Fm–G7–Cm cycle preserved; Bb colour (Abmaj7) retained in bars 37–38.

**2) Phrase Expansion**
- Phrase: Bar 25 melody (C–Eb–G).
- Change: Final note G4 lengthened from half to whole.
- Removed: Eighth-note fragmentation in bars 26–27 (Abmaj7/D7alt melodic activity).
- Added: 2 full bars harmonic stillness (bars 26–27) under Cm9.

**3) Texture Thinning**
- Busiest region: Bars 33–36 (eighth-note runs).
- Removed: Inner-voice motion layer – bars 33–34 simplified from eighth-note pairs to half-note sustained tones.
- Bass/low voice: Sustained whole-note C in bar 33; no rhythmic subdivision in thinned region.

**4) Harmonic Rhythm Audit**
- Bars 25–27: Cm9 extended to 3 bars (consolidated from Cm9–Abmaj7–D7alt).
- Bars 33–34: Cm9 held 2 bars (consolidated; texture thinned).
- Bars 37–38: Cm9, Abmaj7 (2 bars each) – already compliant.
- A section: Preserved (consolidation would remove Bb colour; identity takes precedence).

**5) Identity Preserved**
- Modulation structure: Cm–Fm–G7–Cm, ii–V to D (Em9–A13–Dm9–G13) cycle intact.
- Bb colour: Abmaj7 retained in A (17), B (38), A' (46, 57).
- Asymmetry: Phrase lengths and section lengths remain uneven.
- No phrasing optimisation. No symmetry balancing.

## Confirmation

- **Total form:** A–B–A' (Chorus 1 – Head, Chorus 2 – Solo, Chorus 3 – Chord Solo). Intact.
- **Tonal axis:** C minor primary. D axis (D7alt, Dm9) preserved. Bb colour (Abmaj7, Bbmaj7) preserved.
- **Instrumentation:** Guitar, flugelhorn, upright bass. Unchanged.
- **Approximate duration:** 60 bars at 128 bpm. Overall comparable.
