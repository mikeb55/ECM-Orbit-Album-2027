## Guitar Upgrades (V6)

### 1. Inner-Voice Motion (3 locations)

| Bar | Motion | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **13** | Hold E4, G4→F4 (semit. down) | E4–G4 half, E4–F4 half. Harmonic shift inside stillness. |
| **15** | Hold B3, D4→C4 (semit. down) | B3–D4 half, B3–C4 half. |
| **27** | Hold E3, G3→F3 (semit. down) | E3–G3 half, E3–F3 half. Combined with let-ring. |

Duration: half note or longer. No added attacks. Asymmetrical (all upper-voice moves down).

### 2. Register Commitment

**Section C (18–26):** Guitar entirely in upper register (4th–5th octave). No mid-register drift.
- M19: E4–G4–C5 (was B3–E4–G4)
- M21, M24, M25: D4–F4, G4–C5, D4–F4

### 3. Articulation Variation (Open section 27–33)

| Bar | Technique |
|-----|-----------|
| **27–28** | Let-ring across barline (E3–G3 ties into M28) |
| **29** | Natural harmonic only (B5) — rupture bar |
| **30** | Muted dyad, short articulation (G3–E4 staccato) |

### 4. Coda Refinement

**M51–52:** Final dyad B3–F4
- **B3:** Fades via tie from M51 (quarter) into M52 (half)
- **F4:** Re-attacked softly (pp) in M52 before final silence
