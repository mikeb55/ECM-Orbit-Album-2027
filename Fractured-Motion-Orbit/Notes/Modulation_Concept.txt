Fractured Motion – Orbit Version: Modulation Concept

1. Axis I (Bars 1–16): B minor establishes pedal gravity with add9 colour; no functional dominants.
2. Axis II (Bars 17–32): Pivot on common tone A from B minor into F Lydian; D(add4) and Bbmaj(#11) prepare the shift.
3. Axis III (Bars 33–44): Cmaj7(#11) suspended colour field; registral lift to B5; stepwise descent.
4. Plateau (Bars 45–46): Eb(add9) breaks the F Lydian field; G# destabilising melodic colour; no resolution.
5. Fracture-return (Bars 47–64): Direct return to B minor without dominant function; motivic recall A–B–C–B–A–F#; afterglow on A.
