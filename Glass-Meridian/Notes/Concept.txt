Glass Meridian — Concept
========================

E Dorian opens the piece with modal restraint and a repeating 2-bar bass motif. A chromatic mediant shift to G major brings brighter colour and increased rhythmic motion in the B section. The C section destabilises with a Db Lydian plateau, featuring a sustained fragile flugelhorn tone and suspended bass pedal. Return to E Dorian is achieved via common-tone pivot (E/G#), with no functional dominant cadence. Contrasts with Fractured Motion through more rhythmic life and a subtle internal pulse while retaining ECM economy and space.
