## v2.0 Compliance Certification

### Architecture ✓

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 48–56 bars | 52 bars |
| Asymmetrical sectional design | A (1–5), B (6–12), A' (13–17), C (18–26), Open (27–33), Return (34–42), Coda (43–52) |
| Clear internal contrast | Register shifts, texture reduction, rupture |
| No head-solo-head | ✓ |
| No tonal cadence closure | ✓ |
| **1 destabilisation event** | M29 spatial rupture (no downbeat) + M31 harmonic intrusion (F# maj dyad) |
| **1 subtraction event** | Guitar removed bars 22–23 (flugel + bass only) |
| **Exposed ending** | Bass silent beat 4; guitar B–F tritone; no full ensemble chord |

### Harmonic Language ✓

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| No II–V | ✓ |
| No functional resolution | ✓ |
| No bebop vocabulary | ✓ |
| Asymmetric triad pair | B diminished + C major (oblique, m2 friction) |
| Slonimsky micro-cell | C–D–F#–B (flugel) |
| Minor-2 friction | B/C axis throughout |

### Density Governor ✓

- Max 3 note attacks per bar per instrument
- No comping patterns
- No rhythmic propulsion grid
- Silence is structural

### Bass Autonomy Module ✓

- Max 2 attacks per bar
- Max 2 consecutive whole-note bars (broken by anticipations, neighbor tones)
- ≥1 motion bar per section
- Motions: anticipation pickup, neighbor tone, register shift, chromatic approach (1 per section)
- Counter-contour vs flugel
- Bass removed final beat (M52)

### Guitar Depth Module ✓

- ≥3 inner-voice semitone motions (M13, M15, M27)
- One register-commitment section (C: upper only)
- Articulation-contrast zone: harmonic (M29), muted (M30), let-ring (M27–28)
- Avoid mid-register neutrality

### Flugelhorn Role ✓

- Primary melodic carrier
- Sustained tones (air pressure)
- No bebop phrasing
- No swing articulation

### Ending Rule ✓

- Ambiguous interval: B–F tritone
- No root reinforcement
- Bass silent at final moment
