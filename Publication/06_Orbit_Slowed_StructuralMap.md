## Sectional Architecture (Timeline)

| Time | Section | Bars | Description |
|------|---------|------|--------------|
| 0:00 | A – Axis | 1–12 | 3/4. C major. Floating. No pulse. Flugelhorn enters bar 3. |
| 0:45 | B – Instability | 13–24 | Controlled architectural instability. Guitar fragments. |
| 1:30 | C – Drift | 25–36 | Key centre drifts. Bass sparse. Flugelhorn sustained. |
| 2:15 | D – Dissolve | 37–48 | Texture collapses. Single tones. Fade without resolution. |

---

## Key Centres per Section

- **A:** C major. Clear. Axis established.
- **B:** C with F and G colour. Instability introduced.
- **C:** C–F–G field. No tonic confirmation.
- **D:** C implied. Dissolves. No cadence.

---

## Motivic Material

- **Cell 1:** E5–F5 half-step. Flugelhorn. Axis-defining.
- **Cell 2:** G4–C5 span. Guitar. Harmonic anchor.
- **Cell 3:** Fragmented eighth-note gestures. Destabilising.
- **Cell 4:** Single sustained tones. Exit material.

No theme-and-variation. Cells recur in altered density and order.

---

## Bass Motion Logic

- Pedal C in A. Sparse motion in B. Quarter-note entries in C. Fade in D.
- No walking. No functional bass. Gravity only.
- Entries after silence. No pulse. No swing.

## Texture Density Arc

```
Density:  very low ──► low ──────► medium ──► very low
          A          B            C         D
```

Controlled architectural instability: density rises in B–C then collapses.

## Entry/Exit Cues

| Instrument | Entry | Exit |
|------------|-------|------|
| Guitar | Bar 1. Harmonic field. | Fades. No resolution. |
| Bass | Bar 1 or delayed. Pedal. | Sparse. Fade. |
| Flugelhorn | Bar 3. E5. First tone. | Last sustained tone. Fade. |

## Harmonic Field Description

C major as axis. No functional dominant. Guitar: quartal, cluster, open voicings. F and G introduced as colour, not function. C section: field thins. D: single tones. No V–I. No cadence. Architecture over activity.

---

## Performance Intent Notes

- No traditional solo order. Silence structural.
- Guitar defines harmonic field. Avoid jazz comping patterns.
- Floating, spacious. No swing.
- Architecture over activity. Controlled instability.
