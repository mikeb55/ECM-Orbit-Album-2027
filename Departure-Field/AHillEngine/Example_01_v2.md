## Form Map

| Section | Bars | Length | Content |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| **A** | 1–7 | 7 | HAB1 (E pedal). Zone 1. CELL stated. |
| **B** | 8–16 | 9 | HAB1 cont. Zone 2. Silence pillar bar 8. |
| **C** | 17–23 | 7 | **Plane Shift** → Bb. Guitar implies first; bass delays 1 bar. |
| **Open** | 24–34 | 11 | Constrained open zone. **M28: OPEN RISK** — bass, flugel silent; guitar tritone dyad. |
| **Return** | 35–43 | 9 | E pedal restored. **M36–37: Double-tone bleed.** |
| **Coda** | 44–50 | 7 | **Suspension:** E + #11. No tonal closure. |

**Silence pillars:** Bars 8, 28, 38, 42.

**Asymmetry:** 7+9+7+11+9+7 = 50.

## Harmonic Destabilization Rules Applied

### 1. Delayed Axis Confirmation (M17)
- **Guitar:** Implies Bb field first (Bb–Eb–F voicing with b9 color).
- **Bass:** Silent in M17; Bb pedal enters M18.
- **Effect:** First bar of Section C feels ungrounded.

### 2. Double-Tone Bleed (M36–37)
- **M36:** Guitar E3 + F3 (Bb-field tone F over E bass).
- **M37:** Guitar E3 + Bb3 (Bb retained while bass restores E).
- **Effect:** Axial ambiguity at Return.

### 3. Embedded Micro-Cell
- Micro-cell A–D–Eb hidden in voicing top notes (M2–4, M12–13, M16, M39, M47).
- Voice-leading rather than isolated attacks.

### 4. Contrary Harmonic Gravity
- **M1:** Flugel ascends → guitar E–B–F# (#11) descends.
- **M17:** Flugel Bb-field cell → guitar Bb–Eb–F with b9.

### 5. Open Section Risk (M28)
- **Bass:** Silent.
- **Flugel:** Silent.
- **Guitar:** Sustains tritone dyad B3–F4 (whole bar).

### 6. Coda Suspension (M50)
- **Bass:** E2 pedal.
- **Guitar:** E4 + F#4 (#11). No root closure.
- **Effect:** Unresolved but inevitable.

## CELL

**Intervallic cell (concert pitch):** A4 – D5 – Eb5 – G#5

**Flugelhorn (written):** B4 – E5 – F5 – A#5

**Transformations:** Same as v1; destabilization via harmonic context, not melodic change.

## GCE Scorecard (Target — Harmonic Destabilization)

| Category | Target | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|
| Structural Architecture | ≥ 9.4 | Same form; destabilization via timing/voicing |
| Motivic Integrity | ≥ 9.5 | CELL unchanged; embedded micro-cell |
| Harmonic Atmosphere | ≥ 9.5 | Delayed axis, bleed, suspension |
| Texture/Orchestration | ≥ 9.5 | Restraint; no added density |
| ECM Aesthetic | ≥ 9.6 | Psychological instability; restraint |
| Afterglow | ≥ 9.6 | Coda suspension; open risk |
| **Average** | **≥ 9.6** | |

## Prohibitions Respected

- No new sections.
- No extra bars.
- No increase in rhythmic density.
- No melodic embellishment beyond CELL transformations.
- No mid-register comping.
- No dramatic crescendo.
